## How to run this hands-on (standalone)

During the hands-on session, we will use a cloud facility (from the [ICSC Spoke2 project](https://www.supercomputing-icsc.it/en/spoke-2-fundamental-research-space-economy-en/)). However, if you want to run the code in your personal machine, I prepared a Docker container with all the dependencies installed on a JupyterLab interface.

The instructions on how to run the container are available in this [Github repository](https://github.com/tommasodiotalevi/jupyter-lab_root):

> [!IMPORTANT]
> This repository must be cloned inside the `persistent-storage` folder of the other repository, in order to see it inside the container.
