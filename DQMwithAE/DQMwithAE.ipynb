Being this is an unavoidable effect, we want our models to be able to spot anomalies occuring in every luminosity condition, therefore we would like to account for the luminosity decrease by integrating the luminosity information inside the model. There are many possible ways to do this but the easier one is to add the luminosity value of each LS to the input of the autoencoder both during training and testing. In this exercise we will not include this input because for the particular anomalies presented the model is powerful enough to complete the task without information about the luminosity of each LS."
