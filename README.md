This repository contains the material for the PhD course in Data Science and Computation, at the University of Bologna.

The structure is organized as follows:

[TMVA_Higgs_Classification](TMVA_Higgs_Classification/): First hands-on on a simple classification use-case, using the publicly available [Higgs UCI dataset](http://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/HIGGS). 
> [!NOTE]  
> This hands-on is inspired from the ROOT-TMVA [tutorial](https://root.cern/doc/v630/TMVA__Higgs__Classification_8py.html).
