# TMVA Higgs Classification

First hands-on on a simple classification use-case, using the publicly available [Higgs UCI dataset](http://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/HIGGS). 
> [!NOTE]  
> This hands-on is taken from the ROOT-TMVA [tutorial](https://root.cern/doc/v630/TMVA__Higgs__Classification_8py.html).


## How to run this hands-on standalone

During the hands-on session, we will use a cloud facility (from the [ICSC Spoke2 project](https://www.supercomputing-icsc.it/en/spoke-2-fundamental-research-space-economy-en/). However, if you want to run the code in your personal machine, I prepared a Docker container with all the dependencies installed.

The instructions on how to run the container are available in the [Github repository](https://github.com/tommasodiotalevi/jupyter-lab_root):
